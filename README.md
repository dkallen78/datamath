A reproduction of the Datamath II calculator made by Texas Instruments from 1975

(Calculator)[https://dkallen78.github.io/datamath/calculator.html]

## Keys

You can use the number pad or the regular keys to input to the calculator. C is c,
CE is v, and % is p.

## Overview

Since I don't have a physical Datamath II to play with, I based all of my functionality
on what I saw in the manual.

Some of the interesting things I wasn't expecting were the functions for finding the
square and reciprocal of a number. I also didn't expect the constants and repeating
addition/subtraction (which is often achieved by repeated use of the "=" key).
