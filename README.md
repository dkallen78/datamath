# Datamath â…¡

A reproduction of the Datamath II calculator made by Texas Instruments from 1975

(Calculator)[https://dkallen78.github.io/datamath/calculator.html]

(Manual)[http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/TI-2500-II_US.pdf]

## Keys

You can use the number pad or the regular keys to input to the calculator. C is c,
CE is v, and % is p.

## Overview

Since I don't have a physical Datamath II to play with, I based all of my functionality
on what I saw in the manual.
